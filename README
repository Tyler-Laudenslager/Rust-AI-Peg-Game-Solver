Purpose: This program solves any arbitrary
size peg solitare board producing a move list
that a person can follow to have only one peg
left. This game is commonly seen at Cracker Barrel.

Programming Language Used: Rust 1.56.0

Documentation Website:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html

To build the program for optimized performance use the command
-> cargo build --release

## if there is any build problems use this command to delete the
## target directory.

-> cargo clean

To execute the program
./target/release/peg_game (size of board) (empty position)

such that (size of board) >= 5
and       (empty position) 1-x(x+1)/2 where x = size of the board

To run the program without performance enchancements run the command
-> cargo run (size of board) (empty position)

example -> cargo run 5 1
size of board = 5
empty position = 1

Note: the program eats alot of memory if using board size of 6.
However you can set any position within the constraints of the board to be empty
using a game board of size 5.

This program is not fully optimized due to lack of understanding in how memory management
works in the Rust programming language.
